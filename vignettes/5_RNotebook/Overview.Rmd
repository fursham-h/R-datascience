## Before starting the lesson
In this workshop, we will be using R programming language to process scRNA-seq
data. Please ensure that you have both R and RStudio installed on your computer.
Refer to the links below for instructions to download these software.

* Latest version of R
    - [For Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
    - [For Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
    - [For Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)
        
* [Latest version of RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)


In addition, we will be using several R packages to facilitate this analysis.
To download these R packages on your computer, open RStudio and copy the following
block of code into the console and press Enter:
```{r eval=F}
install.packages("Seurat")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

During the lesson, we will be using etherpad, an online collaborative platform
for our discussions and activities. You may bookmark this

## Lesson materials
In this workshop, we will be using [Seurat 4.0](https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html), 
a powerful R package to analyze scRNA-seq data. This steps of this workflow is 
well-documented and we will be using these vignettes for our references:
