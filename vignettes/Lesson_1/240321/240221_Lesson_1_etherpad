#### Correction for Downloading data file ##
download.file(url="http://bit.ly/cdndata",destfile="gapminder") 

# Once downloaded you read the file into a variable (ie into memory)
gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder")

# The variable name should appear on the righhand pane of Rstudio - clicking should open a view of the data
# Otherwise  you can issue a command to view the data into  RStudio (Then press CTRL or CMD and ENTER): 
View(gapminder)

Activity 2:

Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that will produce a data frame that has the African values for lifeExp, country and year, but not for other Continents. 
How many rows does your data frame have?

What is the one key thing you learn from this workshop?

Abi Gartnerusing dplyr and review of basics of R studio. Very good workshop, 
Adam Pavlinek using dplyr
Ali Asgar Bohra
Alice Rossi using the "pipe" operator
Amy Shakeshaft using pipes and mutating columns
Benedikt Berninger
Catalina Moreno
Clemens Kieckergetting a first idea of the scope and possibilities of R
Corinne Houart
Daphna Fenchel
Fiona Coutts
Grant Wray The structure and syntax of R
Hannah Bruce
Marcelo
Marco massimo
Noor AL-Hajri
Pat GordonUsing dplyr
Richard Taylor


What is the one thing this workshop can improve on?

Abi Gartner having the breakout rooms for helping people is good, but I think it should be used more systematically, and quickly, so that the main lesson plan can move on swiftly. Slightly longer breaks, to avoid screen time fatigue. Very good workshop though.
Adam Pavlinek at the point of data import have a checkpoint to make sure everyone has it so we can move on without getting lost
Ali Asgar Bohra
Alice Rossimaybe it could be spread over a longer time, so it can include more info and be thaught at a slower pace, it was very veyr good though
Amy Shakeshaft statistical analysis and visualisation but this may be covered in future sessions and if so today's session was a good starter!
Benedikt Berninger
Catalina Moreno
Clemens Kieckermaybe more and longer breaks to allow slow burners like me to catch up :)
Corinne Houart
Daphna Fenchel
Fiona Coutts
Grant Wray Plotting package? Visualisation.
Hannah Bruce
Marcelo
Marco massimo data import
Noor AL-Hajri
Pat GordonThe first half was mostly review for me, while the second half was very useful.  Separating those two parts into different classes could target the course better to people who are totally new to R versus people who use it some but not very much
