# Open your terminal or git bash

# printing working directory
pwd


# changing working directory
cd /

# list files
ls

# You can press on up-arrow to show previous typed codes

# Adding flags
ls -l

# show function help page
man ls
# note to windows user: man function may not be available on git bash
# alternatively use --help
ls - - help

# clearing screens
clear

### ls other directories and tab completion
ls -l dev
ls -l ~
ls -l <drag directory>
ls -l <copy and paste path from finder or windows explorer>
ls -l d<tab>
ls -l b<tab>

# using wildcards
ls -l bin/b*

### ACTIVITY 1 (2 mins)
# Do each of the following tasks from your current directory using a single ls command for each:
# 
#     List all of the files in /usr/bin that start with the letter ‘c’.
#     List all of the files in /usr/bin that contain the letter ‘a’.
#     List all of the files in /usr/bin that end with the letter ‘o’.


### Changing directory
cd ~/Desktop

# if directory is not present, an error will appear
cd Downloads
## cd: /home/cdn-bc/Desktop/Documents: No such file or directory

# moving up one directory
cd ..

## Full paths vs relative paths
cd ~/Desktop
cd ~/Downloads
cd ../Desktop

# ACTIVITY 2 (2min)

Answer: 4

### Making folders and subfolders
mkdir test_folder
mkdir test_folder2
mkdir test_folder/subfolder
mkdir "test_folder/sub folder 2"

## copying files
cp test_file.txt test_folder
ls -l test_folder

### mv to move files
mv *.txt test_folder/subfolder

### mv to rename file
mv test_folder2 renamed_folder

## Edit text files directly in terminal
cd test_folder
nano test_file.txt

#### edit the text file as how you normally do
#### save file contents using ctrl+S (or cmd+s on MacOS)
#### exit nano using ctrl+X

# Preview a text file (first 10 lines by default)
head test_file.txt

# Preview the first 4 lines of a text file
cat -n test_file.txt

## Deleting files
rm test_file.txt

## deleting folders
cd ..
rm -r test_folder

## BREAKKKK (10 mins) and ACTIVITY 3
# Create the following filestructure in your home folder (~)
# ~
# ↳ RNAseq_workshop
#   ↳ logs
#   ↳ metadata
#   ↳ originals
#     ↳ FASTQ
#   ↳ outputs
#   ↳ scripts

Answer:
cd ~
mkdir RNAseq_workshop
mkdir RNAseq_workshop/logs
mkdir RNAseq_workshop/metadata
mkdir RNAseq_workshop/originals
mkdir RNAseq_workshop/originals/FASTQ
mkdir RNAseq_workshop/outputs
mkdir RNAseq_workshop/scripts

# CLASS RESUME AT 1130am #################

# Popular RNAseq data repository
# https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
# https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home

## Downloading FASTQ file(s)
cd ~/RNAseq_workshop/originals/FASTQ

## Sample ENA https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA476008

# There are two functions commonly used to download files from internet (curl or wget)
## Some operating systems may not have either of this function
## To check if you have curl or wget, type these:
which curl
which wget
# and you should get a path to the script if the function is present

# installing fastq read pair from SRR7311317
curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR731/007/SRR7311317/SRR7311317_1.fastq.gz
curl -O ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR731/007/SRR7311317/SRR7311317_2.fastq.gz

# decompress files.
## This is needed to if you wish to preview the files
## However, most RNAseq tools can process compressed files, so you don't need
## to decompress to use these tools (FastQC, Trimmomatic, Kallisto etc)
gunzip SRR7311317_1.fastq.gz

# preview first 10 lines of FASTQ file
head SRR7311317_1.fastq

# preview first 4 lines of FASTQ file
## each sequence contain 4 lines of information
### Line 1: sequence ID
### Line2: called sequence
### Line 3: default + character
### Line 4: sequence quality
head -n 4 SRR7311317_1.fastq

# preview last 4 lines of FASTQ file
tail -n 4 SRR7311317_1.fastq


# SEARCH for PATTERN USING GREP
## grep will output all lines that contain the pattern
grep NN SRR7311317_1.fastq

# you can preview the first 10 lines by "piping" grep into head as such:
grep NN SRR7311317_1.fastq | head

# you can also count the number of sequence with said pattern using wc
## wc is short for word count. the -l flag will count the number of lines, instead of
## the number of word (default)
grep NN SRR7311317_1.fastq | wc -l

# Saving output of grep to a text file.
## The > operator will create a file named Ns.txt and flush the output of grep into said file
## If Ns.txt already exist, > will overwrite existing content of Ns.txt
## To apped the content instead of overwriting, use >> 
grep NN SRR7311317_1.fastq > Ns.txt
grep NN SRR7311317_1.fastq >> Ns.txt

# specifying -B and -A flag allow you to return the number of lines preceding (-B) and
## following (-A) the grep hits. The value after -B and -A specify the number of lines
grep -B1 -A2 NN SRR7311317_1.fastq | head

# ACTIVITY 5 (5 mins)
# Report the following to a text file
# 1. count the number of sequences in SRR7311317_1.fastq
# 2. count the number of sequences in SRR7311317_1.fastq containing illumina adapter sequences (CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT) 

Answer:
## Each sequence ID begins with @SRR. You can use this pattern to search and for 
## all sequence IDs and count them
grep @SRR SRR7311317_1.fastq | wc -l > activity5.txt
grep CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT SRR7311317_1.fastq | wc -l >> activity5.txt 


# Compressing files
gzip SRR7311317_1.fastq
