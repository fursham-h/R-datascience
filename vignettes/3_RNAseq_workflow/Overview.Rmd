## Before starting the lesson
In this workshop, we will be using UNIX Shell to navigate around our computer
filesystem and to process publicly-available RNAseq data. Please refer to this
[setup instructions](https://fursham-h.github.io/R-datascience/articles/3_RNAseq_workflow/installations.html#bashday1) to check if your operating system comes pre-installed
with Shell.  

We will also be using several command-line programs to process reads from RNAseq
experiments. **These programs will be required only for day 2 of the workshop, and
we will briefly go through the installation process during day 1**. For instructions
on installing these software, please refer to this [setup instructions](https://fursham-h.github.io/R-datascience/articles/3_RNAseq_workflow/installations.html#bashday2). 

During the lesson, we will be using etherpad, an online collaborative platform
for our discussions and activities. The link to this workshop's etherpad page
can be found [here](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/CDN-RNAseqIntro-online). You may
