Lesson: Data Visualization using R
Date: 29th April 2021
Time: 10am to 12pm
---------------------------------------------

## Lesson preparation ##
Before the start of this lesson, please ensure that you have the required software installed on your computer.
Please visit https://fursham-h.github.io/R-datascience/articles/2_Data_visualisation_using_R/Overview.html
ham-h.github.io/R-datascience/articles/2_Data_visualisation_using_R/Overview.html for details on software installation and for more information on the schedule of this class.

Looking forward to learn R with you soon!

Activity 1:
What are 2 things you like and 2 things you don't like about when using Excel/Graphpad?

    
## install packages; ggplot2, ggpubr; tidyr; dplyr
install.packages("ggplot2")

# to test if package is installed
library(ggplot2)

## importing dge_data.tsv
dge <- read.delim("~/Downloads/dge_data.tsv")

# if data is found in dekstop
dge <- read.delim("~/Desktop/dge_data.tsv")

# use a graphics interface to locate files
dge <- read.delim(file.choose())
    
# importing tpm_matrix.tsv
tpm <- read.delim("~/Downloads/tpm_matrix.tsv")
    
    # saving environment
save.image()
    
ggplot(data = dge, mapping = aes())    
    
ggplot(data = dge, mapping = aes(x = A_vs_B.log2FC)) +
    geom_density(colour = "darkred", fill = "purple4", size = 5)

# Common ggplot geometry functions
# - geom_point()
# - geom_bar()
# - geom_boxplot()
# - geom_density()
# - geom_jitter()
# - geom_histogram()
# - geom_violin()
# - stat_ecdf()

# possible arguments to modify plot aesthetics
# colour
# fill
# size
# alpha
# shape

# colour palette
# http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour
    
# modifying background themes
http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-themes-and-background-colors-the-3-elements

## Plotting a bivariate graph
ggplot(dge, aes(x = A.TpM, y = B.TpM)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "Gene expression in A [TpM]",
         y = "Gene expression in B [TpM]")

Activity 3:
Modify the code below to change the color and size of the points on the point layer
ggplot(dge, aes(x = A.TpM, y = B.TpM)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "Gene expression in A [TpM]",
         y = "Gene expression in B [TpM]") +
    scale_x_log10() +
    scale_y_log10()

# changing shape of datapoints
# http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-point-shapes

## Adding a grouping variable
dge <- dge %>% 
    mutate(group = ifelse(A_vs_B.FDR < 0.05 & abs(A_vs_B.log2FC) > log2(1.5), "Regulated", "Non-regulated"))

dge <- dge %>% 
    arrange(group)

# dge <- dge %>% 
    # arrange(desc(group))

ggplot(dge, aes(x = A.TpM, y = B.TpM, colour = group, alpha = group)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "Gene expression in A [TpM]",
         y = "Gene expression in B [TpM]") +
    scale_x_log10() +
    scale_y_log10() +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("grey10", "indianred4")) +
    scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0.2, 1))

tpm <- tpm %>% 
    gather(Sample, TpM, A_1:B_3) %>% 
    mutate(Group = substr(Sample,start = 0, stop = 1))
    

my_comparisons <- list(c("A", "B"))
# my_comparisons <- list(c("A", "B"), c("B", "C")) # multiple comparisons

ggboxplot(tpm, x = "Group", y = "TpM", xlab = "", add = "jitter", facet.by = "Isoform",
          fill = "Group", palette = "Paired") +
    stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, method = "t.test", label = "p.signif")

Hi Fursham, my internet connection is not stable enough. I quit for today, but more important that my folks takes the lesson! It's really very useful. Thanks so much!!!
Don't worry! I will send you our script for you to test things out. Do let me know if you have any questions.
