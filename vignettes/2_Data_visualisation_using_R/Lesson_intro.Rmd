### Why visualize data using programming language?
A myriad of data visualization software are currently available to generate
beautiful graphs for the purpose of publishing, presenting or sharing data. 
While most of these software are intuitive and easy-to-use, programming languages
offer superior advantages in which:

1) It is able to handle large amount of data
2) It could easily create reproducible publication-grade images
3) It naturally incorporates statistical anlayses
4) It drives you to think about data organization

<br/>
```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/jobsquote.PNG")
```
<br/>

### Data structure for plotting 
Almost everyone is familiar with using spreadsheets to easily create tabular data
and intuitively generate simple graphs for visualization. Using a graphic user
interface, spreadsheets make it possible to specify data values by selecting
the desired "cells" containing your data. Although programming languages such as 
R and python do not offer the liberty of highlighting desired data values, it
teaches us to effectively organize our data to facilitate data visualization.  

In this section, we will go through some common data structures for 
data visualization in R.  
<br/>

#### **Data-frames**
Two-dimensional graphs, consisting of an independent variable (x-axis) and a 
dependent variable (y-axis), are most commonly plotted. 
Therefore effectively, a two-columned data-frame is the most
basic data structure for data visualization.
There are exceptions to this; some plots can be generated from a single-columned 
data-frame as the dependent variable (y-axis) is derived from the distribution
of the data-points. Such plots include histograms, density plots 
and empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF).  

<!-- IDEA: add a figure on two-columned df for plotting graphs -->

<!-- Formatting data into a two-columned df -->
<!-- Data types -->

<!-- Grouping data using additional variables, usually as factors -->

#### **Matrices**

#### **Lists/Vectors**

### R packages for data visualisation 

#### **Base R**

#### **Lattice**

#### **ggplot2**

#### **ggplot2 on steroids**

#### **pheatmap**

#### **ggvenn**
