## Before starting the lesson
Please ensure that you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on 
your computer. You may refer to this [link](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/#preparations) 
for step-by-step instructions on downloading these software.  

We will also be using the `gapminder` data for our hands-on tutorial. You may
download this [csv file](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/k1768990_kcl_ac_uk/ElAlwol0kydHps1zyu1TqL8BS4Az_IniKS7uReVMjKjSgw?e=JVktTj)
onto your local directory. **Please take note of the location of this file on your computer.**
Alternatively, you may run the following code in RStudio to download this file
to your R working directory (commonly at your home directory).
```{r}
download.file("bit.ly/cdndata", "gapminder.csv")
```
