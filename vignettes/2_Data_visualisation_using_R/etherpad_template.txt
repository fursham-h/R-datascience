Activity 1:
What are 2 things you like and 2 things you don't like about when using Excel/Graphpad?

Activity 2:
1) Install ggplot2, ggpubr, dplyr and tidyr
2) Import dge_data.tsv into R as a data-frame.

Activity 3:
Modify the code below to change the color and size of the points on the point layer

dotplot <- ggplot(dge, aes(x=A.TpM, y = B.TpM)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "Gene expression in sample A [TpM]", 
         y = "Gene expression in sample B [TpM]") +
    scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10")


Activity 4:
Modify the code below to change the shape of datapoints from the two groupings.

dotplot.label <- ggplot(dge, aes(x=A.TpM, y= B.TpM, colour = group)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10") + 
    labs(x = "Gene expression in sample A [TpM]",
         y = "Gene expression in sample B [TpM]",
         colour = "") +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("grey80", "navyblue")) +
    theme_minimal()

Home activity (optional):
Generate a Volcano Plot with log2FC as the x-axis and -log(FDR) as the y-axis.
You may modify the colour, shape and/or size of each datapoint to best
represent your data. As a bonus, you may attempt to label some differentially
expressed genes (top 10 up- and down-regulated genes). 

Send your graphs to me via email and I will anonymously upload your plots 
to be shared with others.
