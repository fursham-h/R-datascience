######> 4. Data frame Manipulation with dplyr

Activity 2:

Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that will produce a data frame that has the African values for lifeExp, country and year, but not for other Continents. 
How many rows does your data frame have and why?

Please type your answers out below (1 answer per group)

Group 1
Group 2
Group 3
Group 4
Group 5
Group 6
Group 7

year_country_lifeExp_Africa <- gapminder %>%
                           filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
                           select(year, country, lifeExp)
624 rows



Activity 3:

Calculate the average life expectancy per country. Which has the longest average life expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?

Please type your answers out below (1 answer per group)
Group 1
Group 2
Group 3
Group 4
Group 5
Group 6
Group 7

Self exercise:
Calculate the average life expectancy in 2002 of 2 randomly selected countries for each continent. Then arrange the continent names in reverse order. Hint: Use the dplyr functions arrange() and sample_n(), they have similar syntax to other dplyr functions. Export data-frame to a tab-delimited text file.

Questions:
could you show how do you filter by column number instead of header? 
How do you know when you need to use the summarize() function and when you donâ€™t?
