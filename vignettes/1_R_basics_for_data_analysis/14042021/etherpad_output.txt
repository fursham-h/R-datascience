## Lesson preparation ##
Before the start of this lesson, please ensure that you have the required software installed on your computer.

Please visit https://fursham-h.github.io/R-datascience/articles/Lesson_1.html for details on this installation and for more information on the schedule on this class.

Looking forward to learning R with you soon!

Questions gallery:

Testing: What do you mean Martina and Maria changed their colours?
I cannot find the list with the names
I see now the names but can't change the colour :)
Had a problem (apparently) can now see colour wheel but colour I pick not staying
Not that the colour matters just getting things to work...


Managed! :)

Check-in exercise:

How would you use R in your work?

Alfonso Aguilera
Fazal Oozeer-to be able to check a large set of results
Frederike Winkel - data analysis, coding, statistics
Maria Conde-Dusman - to analyze RNAseq data
Martyna Panasiuk - more flexible data analysis and visualisation options than in what I normally use (GraphPad)
Megan Maloney to analyse large datasets & stats
Paul Hopkins
Rachel Moore
Rita Sousa-Nunesanalyse various omic data; intersections of this; display complex data
Valentina Marchica



Activity 1

Which of the following are valid R variable names?

Type the number "1" on variable names you think is valid in R and "0" on invalid names.

1 min_height 1110
1 max.height 110
0_age 00000
0 .mass0000
1 MaxLength 1111
0 min-length1100
0 2widths1010
1 celsius2kelvin00

What is the one key thing you learn from this workshop?

Alfonso Aguilera
Fazal Oozeer-how to navigate in the R pages and learned the various commands
Frederike Winkel how to arrange data, pipes and how to create variables and manipulate them/work with them
Maria Conde-Dusman different packages and pipes
Martyna Panasiuk using pipes and how easy data transformation is in R
Megan Maloney
Paul Hopkins
Rachel Moore
Rita Sousa-NunesR is not scary :) It's actually fun
Valentina Marchica


What is the one thing this workshop can improve on?

Alfonso Aguilera
Fazal Oozeer- face to face -very informative workshop 
Frederike Winkel
Maria Conde-Dusman
Martyna Panasiuk maybe a little bit more about importing data from Excel, Matlab usually gives me issues with that but maybe in R it is simpler? Esp. if the Excel file is not arranged exactly the way I want and I would like to import it to R and transform into my desired table arrangement. Thank you for a very good workshop!

Rita Sousa-NunesSet a piece of "homework" (challenging but not toooo challenging)
Valentina Marchica

Alfonso:12:22 1. Simple and very helpful data manipulation of complex datasets, making them more accesible and easy to process
Alfonso:12:23 2. Maybe, use one example of a real biological dataset (e.g. RNA-seq)
