Check-in exercise:

How would you use R in your work?

Benedikt Berninger
Marcelo
Laia Torres MasjoanNot using R at the moment
Sophie Péron
Ana Beltran- not using R currently - analysing/plotting data?
Alexis 3-4 x week, single-cell analysis (RNAseq +ATACseq)
Youran single-cell seq data analysis: seurat & monocle so far
Nicolas
Not using R so far...


Activity 1

Which of the following are valid R variable names?

Type the number "1" on variable names you think is valid in R and "0" on invalid names.

min_height1111
max.height1111
_age0000
.mass0?00
MaxLength1111
min-length000 (it is a funtion)
2widths110
celsius2kelvin111

Activity 2:

Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that will produce a data frame that has the African values for lifeExp, country and year, but not for other Continents. 
How many rows does your data frame have?

Please type your answers out below 

Group 1 (Room 1): 
Group 2 (Room 2): 624
 Africa <- gapminder %>% filter(continent == "Africa") %>% 
  select(lifeExp, country, year)
dim(Africa)

What is the one key thing you learn from this workshop?


Benedikt Berningertotally new to coding, and R, so got out many basic operations
Marcelo
Laia Torres Masjoan
Sophie Péron
Ana Beltran
Alexis
Youran
Nicolas


What is the one thing this workshop can improve on?


Benedikt Berningermaybe beofr starting to write the code, explain the logical operations that need to be done (e.g. in etherpad).
